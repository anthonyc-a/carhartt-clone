            Our core collection of classic icons is accompanied by contemporary
            reworkings of enduring, workwear-inspired silhouettes such as the{" "}
            <a href="#a">Michigan Coat</a> and <a href="#a">Single Knee Pant</a>{" "}
            , updated with seasonal detailing, colorways and prints, such as our
            camouflage. Our latest collection features utilitarian details,
            simple cuts and nods to a host of Carhartt WIP staples, while a host
            of new styles and fabrics provide fresh seasonal updates to garments
            such as the <a href="#a">Bib Overall</a> and our classic
            cotton-jersey blend <a href="#a">t-shirts</a>
            .

            New arrivals for this season include both lightweight and
            heavyweight outdoor-themed capsules created in a technical,
            structured fabric, with a focus on warmth and functionality.
